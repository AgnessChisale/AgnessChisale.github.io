    "text": "About Me\nI am a geospatial analyst and environmental scientist passionate about using spatial data, GIS and remote sensing to support environmental management and data-driven decision-making. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Geomatics for Environmental Management at the University of British Columbia, where I am strengthening my expertise in spatial analysis, remote sensing, GIS workflows, and environmental applications of geospatial data. I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Environmental Science and Technology (Environmental Management) from the University of Malawi, earned with distinction. I am technically fluent in ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, PostgreSQL/Post GIS, Python and R requiring hands on experience in spatial data management, geoprocessing workflows, environmental mapping and the integration of remotely sensed and field-collected datasets."
